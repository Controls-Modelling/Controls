\begin{abstract}
  This study examines the robust stability of a power system, which is based on proportional-integral-derivative load
frequency control and involves uncertain parameters and time delays. The model of the system is firstly established, following which
the system is transformed into a closed-loop system with feedback control. On this basis, a new augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK)
functional is established for using the new Bessel-Legendre inequality to estimate the derivative of the functional, which can provide
a maximum lower bound. A stability criterion is then derived by employing the LK functional and Bessel-Legendre inequality. Finally,
numerical examples are used to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed method.

\section{Introduction}
% Here we have the typical use of a "W" for an initial drop letter
% and "RITE" in caps to complete the first word.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

\IEEEPARstart{W}{rite} why is important to do this experiment, what background is needed, what technology has been used in this session, you can also talk briefly about what other technology exist but was not used here.
Then explain briefly how the experiment was conducted, what measurements were taken, what technology is used (acquisition system, sensors, software), if calculations were done, what calculations were done, what decisions were made, and what the final result was (explained in a concise way with words).
Writing “good” reports requires much thought, organization and editing but the rewards are
great. Those students who can master good technical writing skills will find greater success and
opportunity as professionals in industry. \\
You should become proficient at using your word processor for such items as page
numbers, formatting tables, creating graphs, inserting Greek symbols, and using
superscripts and subscripts.  \\

Remember that once you graduate, industry will require you to write well. In some cases, you will be involved in writing proposals or possibly final design reports. It is possible that you will be required to assist in writing user or maintenance manuals. Certainly, you will always be required to write short reports and memos detailing your activities. It is our objective to train you to write well by the time you have graduated. An excellent style manual for science writers is [3]. \\
You should become proficient at using the equation editor (Word has a built-in equation editor that can be accessed by “inserting object”. or you can use Latex editor). \\

Normal text is to be single-spaced in 10-point Times or Times Roman (or similar font), with 12-point interline spacing, in the two-column 
format. The first line of each paragraph is to be indented approximately 1/4 inch (approx. 0.7 cm), and the entire text is to be justified -- that is, flush left and flush right. Please do not place additional line spacing between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be Helvetica 10-point boldface; callouts should be Helvetica 9-point 
nonboldface.  \\

TITLE AND HEADINGS. The main title should be in Times (or Times Roman) 14-point boldface centered over both columns. In the main title, please initially capitalize nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, and prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Initially capitalize only the first word in first-, second-, and third-order headings. Leave two blank lines before author names(s)/affiliation(s).

\section{System Model and Derivations}
\section{Results}
Show plots of any data collected and describe with words what your plots are showing. Describe the relationship between variables and time. Remember to number all your figures.  This is the most critical part affect the technical achievement.\\
No picture, table, schematic, or graph should appear without a name (generally of the form Fig.1 o Table 1). %~\ref{fig:ecg} or Table~\ref{table:Exps}), 
None should appear without a reference to them by name in the main body of the writing.
All figures and tables must be discussed in the text, including what it is, significant observations, and analysis. \\
Capitalize “Table” and “Fig.” any time they are accompanied by specific table or figure numbers. Examples: “The measured data are plotted in Fig. 2. The figure shows a linear relationship in....”. “The table shows …” vs. “The data of Table 3…” \\

\begin{table}[!ht] %[H]
\centering
\label{table:Exps}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Student &  Max Temperature \\ \hline
aabbbccc &  $35^{\circ}$   \\
eeeddd &   $54^{\circ}$ \\
eeeddd &   $54^{\circ}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Temperature measurements performed for session 1.}
\end{table}

%you can use a table generator from here: https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#

Use your word processor to make “real tables” (i.e., boxed in, etc.). Center all tables and include a heading and caption with the appropriate table number below each table. For example, “Table 1: Temperature measurements performed for session 1.” 

Figures must be centered, and the figure number and caption is centered beneath the
figure. For example, “Figure~\ref{fig:ecg}”. 

\begin{figure}[H]%[!ht]
\begin {center}
\caption{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs may fit across both columns, if necessary. Your artwork must be in place in the article.}
\label{fig:ecg}
\end {center}
\end{figure}

Always spell out table or Table. Give abbreviation of Figure, i.e., Fig., when used in
the middle to end of sentence, but spell it out when used at the very start of the
sentence. \\


All graphs must be done with a computer (i.e., spreadsheet software such as
Microsoft Excel or even Matlab.). Do not include hand drawn graphs unless
specifically instructed to do so.  \\
Include a leading zero when a number’s magnitude is less than 1 (use 0.83 instead of
writing .83). \\
Use your word processor for Greek symbols for common engineering quantities as $\beta$, $\pi$, $\gamma$ ,$\Omega$ . 

\section{Discussion and Summary}
Discuss any interesting result related to the materials used or to any claim from the introduction. Discuss your measurements using engineering terms (accuracy, precision, resolution, etc).  Give technical conclusions. Restate the main objectives and how or to what degree they were achieved. What principles, laws and/or theory
were validated by the experiment? Describe some applications of your results and comment any possible recommended future work.



% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)

\appendices
\section{Hand calculations (or name your title for appendix subtitle)}
List any extra evidence such as photos of the session, that may help you support your claims.
You can include all hand calculations, extra graphs and plots, simulation results, etc.
